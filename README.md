# MediNova 🏥
### High-Velocity Medical Simulation UI | Pan-African Team Lead Project

MediNova is a high-pressure medical simulation prototype engineered in a **48-hour sprint**. As the **Product Architect and Team Lead**, I coordinated a distributed, pan-African engineering team to deliver a production-grade interface under extreme constraints.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **10x Shipping Velocity:** Built from ideation to functional prototype in under 2 days using AI-augmented engineering workflows.
- **Leadership:** Managed a cross-functional team across multiple time zones, navigating communication gaps and English fluency challenges.
- **State Management:** Engineered a zero-latency UI capable of handling high-frequency data updates for real-time simulation tracking.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (High-fidelity, responsive UI)
- **Workflow:** AI-Augmented Development (Cursor/Claude), Agile Sprints
